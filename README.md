# sskm
Simple Ssh Key Manager for Linux (and possibly Unix)

##### Looking for programmmers
I'm not a good enough programmer to get this going and I don't have the time to become one. If you're interested in this project, just let me know and I'll add you as a collaborator.

### Usecase
Imagine a small network of Linux and Unix machines withthout centralized authentication instances like LDAP or NIS. This might be the case in a home network (NAS, mobile phones, notebooks, VCRs,...) or in small sports clubs. Setting up Kerberos would be overkill and you might not have root on all machines anyway. You log into the various devices and machines via **ssh** and would like to **facilitate the management of your public keys**.
